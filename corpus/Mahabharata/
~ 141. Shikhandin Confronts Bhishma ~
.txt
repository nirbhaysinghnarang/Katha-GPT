On the tenth day the Pandavas realized they could use Shikhandin against Bhishma: Shikhandin had been born a woman, and Bhishma would not fight a woman. So Shikhandin rode forward and, under Arjuna's protection, began shooting at Bhishma."I won't fight you, Shikhandin," Bhishma shouted."Fight or not," Shikhandin replied, "I will slay you today. I was born for this!"Shikhandin continued firing, and Arjuna shot Bhishma too. The old warrior's body was pierced everywhere with arrows. When he fell, he didn't touch the ground. Instead, he rested on a bed of arrows.Both sides stopped fighting when Bhishma fell.
