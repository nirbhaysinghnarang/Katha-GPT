Laura Gibbs · 98. Vyasa Advises Yudhishthira
Yudhishthira apologized for the suffering he had brought upon his family. "I gambled because I wanted to depose Duryodhana so that we could rule the whole kingdom," he confessed. "But I realize anger about this serves no purpose now. I must practice patience, certain that someday we'll regain our kingdom."Draupadi and the others, however, did not share Yudhishthira's equanimity.Then Vyasa arrived, and he taught Yudhishthira a mantra that controlled a great weapon. "Teach this mantra to Arjuna," he said, "and send Arjuna out to search for more weapons. You must be prepared for the war that is coming."
