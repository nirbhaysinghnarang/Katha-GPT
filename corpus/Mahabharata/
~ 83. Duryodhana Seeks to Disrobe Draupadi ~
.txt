Laura Gibbs · 83. Duryodhana Seeks to Disrobe Draupadi
"Strip off your clothes, slaves!" Duryodhana commanded. "Now!"The Pandavas stripped until they stood in only their loincloths."You too, whore!" Duryodhana ordered Draupadi. "Strip!" At a nod from Duryodhana, Dushasana reached for Draupadi's sari and began to pull, but Draupadi closed her eyes and prayed. "Lord Vishnu, save me," she murmured. "Save me, God! Save me!"Dushasana pulled off her sari, but there was another sari underneath, and another, an unending stream of cloth. Dushasana pulled and pulled until he became so entangled in the heap of cloth that he could pull no more.God had heard Draupadi's prayer.
