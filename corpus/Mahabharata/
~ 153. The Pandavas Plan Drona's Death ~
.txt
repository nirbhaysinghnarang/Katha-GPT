Laura Gibbs · 153. The Pandavas Plan Drona's Death
"We must stop Drona," Krishna advised the Pandavas. "We'll tell him that his son Ashwatthama is dead. He'll lose the will to fight, and then we will kill him.""But who will do these terrible things?" Yudhishthira groaned. "Who will lie to Drona, and who will kill him?""You always tell the truth, Yudhishthira," answered Arjuna, "so you must be the one to tell Drona about Ashwatthama, and Dhrishtadyumna will kill him." Arjuna wept as he contemplated Drona's death. Bhima, meanwhile, grabbed his mace and felled an elephant. "That elephant was named Ashwatthama," he declared. "It's true: Ashwatthama is dead."
