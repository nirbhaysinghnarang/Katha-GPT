"Who did this?" Drona shouted, pointing to the arrows in the dog's mouth.Ekalavya stepped forward. "I did!"Drona recognized the forest-boy. "Who trained you?""You did," Ekalavya replied, proudly showing Drona the statue he had made, certain Drona would now accept him as his student.But instead, Drona said, "Since I was your guru, you must now pay the guru-fee.""Anything!" exclaimed Ekalavya."Give me the thumb of your right hand," said Drona.Ekalavya did not hesitate; he cut off his thumb and presented it to Drona.Drona smiled; the boy would never again rival Arjuna as an archer.Inspired by: Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharataby Devdutt Pattanaik.Notes: This story is on p. 65.the gurudakshina
