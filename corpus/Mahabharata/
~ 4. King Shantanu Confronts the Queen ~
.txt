King Shantanu's queen drowned their first child in the river, and their second. One by one, she drowned seven children.Shantanu said nothing.When she gave birth to their eighth child, Shantanu shouted, "Stop! I forbid you to kill this child.""The child will live, but I must leave you now," the queen replied. "I am Ganga, goddess of this river, and I came to earth in order to marry you, bear your children, and drown them as soon as they were born. Our children were the eight Vasus, gods of the eight elements, cursed to be born as humans."
