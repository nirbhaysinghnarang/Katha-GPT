Laura Gibbs · 51. Duryodhana Plots against the Pandavas
King Dhritarashtra ordered a beautiful palace built for the Pandavas in Varanavata, and he put his son Duryodhana in charge.Duryodhana, meanwhile, turned the palace into a deadly trap, arranging for the building materials to be soaked in oil and resin so he could burn the Pandavas alive in their home.But Vidura, Dhritarashtra's low-born brother, warned his nephews to beware. "The wise jackal's den has more than one exit," he told Yudhishthira. "I understand," said Yudhishthira, smiling. The Pandavas pretended to be delighted with their new palace, but they secretly built a tunnel that would provide a safe escape.
