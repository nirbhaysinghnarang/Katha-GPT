Laura Gibbs · 57. Drupada Holds a Swayamvara
Kings and princes thronged the stadium, eager to compete for Draupadi, King Drupada's fire-born daughter. Drupada had put a revolving fish-shaped target high on a pole, and the archer had to shoot by looking at the target reflected in a pan of oil below.Many princes tried and failed.Then it was Karna's turn. He nocked an arrow confidently, but before he could shoot, Draupadi exclaimed, "I recognize this so-called king! He's just a charioteer. Send him away!""He is King of Anga," Duryodhana protested. "Let him compete!""No, my friend," Karna said to Duryodhana. "I do not want her."
