Laura Gibbs · 41. Drona Gets Revenge
"For the guru-fee," Drona said to his pupils, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, "you will attack King Drupada. Seize him, and bring him here."The princes succeeded, and they brought Drupada in chains to Drona."I could kill you right now, Drupada," said Drona, "but I will not kill you. I want us to be friends." Drona then smiled a cold smile. "Friends must be equals. So I will take half of your kingdom."Drupada stared at him in angry silence. "That makes us equals," Drona continued, "and now we can be friends." Drupada agreed, but he never forgave Drona.
