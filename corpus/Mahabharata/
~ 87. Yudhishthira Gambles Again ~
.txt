Laura Gibbs · 87. Yudhishthira Gambles Again
Duryodhana's messenger overtook the Pandavas. "Duryodhana challenges you again!" he said. "The losers will be exiled into the wilderness for twelve years, followed by one year in disguise. If they are discovered in that year, another thirteen years of exile will follow."Again, Yudhishthira's sense of royal duty meant he could not refuse the challenge.Again, Shakuni won.The Pandavas had to go into exile."Let Kunti stay here with us," Vidura said, and the Pandavas tearfully bid their mother farewell.As they left Hastinapura, the Kauravas mocked their cousins, but the people pitied the princes and their noble wife.
