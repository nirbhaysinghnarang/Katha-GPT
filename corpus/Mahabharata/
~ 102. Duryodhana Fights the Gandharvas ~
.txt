Laura Gibbs · 102. Duryodhana Fights the Gandharvas
On his way to the Pandavas, Duryodhana's messenger met a gandharva, sent by the gods to cause trouble. And trouble there was: the messenger fought with the gandharva, and soon Duryodhana himself and his whole army were fighting with an army of gandharvas. Then the gandharvas took Duryodhana prisoner, while Duryodhana's soldiers all fled in fear.When Yudhishthira learned the news, he sent Bhima and Arjuna to rescue Duryodhana. "He's still our cousin after all," Yudhishthira said. So Bhima and Arjuna rescued Duryodhana, and they taunted him for needing their help.The incident made Duryodhana hate the Pandavas even more.
