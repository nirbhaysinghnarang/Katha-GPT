Laura Gibbs · 77. Duryodhana Plots with Shakuni
King Dhritarashtra had a lavish new palace built for Duryodhana, hoping to calm his jealousy of Yudhishthira's palace, but to no avail. Duryodhana was still determined to get revenge.Rebuffed by his father, Duryodhana plotted with Shakuni, his mother's brother. "I want the Pandavas to lose everything!" Duryodhana snarled. "What do you advise?""You cannot wage war against them," Shakuni replied, "but you could challenge Yudhishthira to a game of dice. Royal honor will require him to accept your invitation, but he has absolutely no skill at dice. I will compete for you against him, and I will surely win."
