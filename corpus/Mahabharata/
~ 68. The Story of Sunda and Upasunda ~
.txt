Laura Gibbs · 68. The Story of Sunda and Upasunda
The rishi Narada visited Yudhishthira's court at Indraprastha, and he told the Pandavas this story as a warning:The twin asura brothers, Sunda and Upasunda, tormented the world. No creature, mortal or immortal, could defeat them.The god Brahma then created a perfectly beautiful apsara: Tilottama.Dressed in a sari of red silk, she danced before the brothers. They were captivated. "She's mine!" shouted Sunda."No!" shouted Upasunda. "She's mine! I saw her first!""No!" shouted Sunda. "I saw her first!"Because the brothers were equally strong, they killed each other as they fought.The Pandava brothers heeded Narada's warning.
