Laura Gibbs Â· 14. Amba Prays to the Gods
When Parashurama failed to defeat Bhishma, Amba despaired. She prayed to the gods to avenge her humiliation. She stood on one foot on top of a high mountain, through hot and cold, in sun and snow, not eating and not drinking until the gods answered her.Years passed.Finally Shiva appeared. "You will bring about Bhishma's death, but not in this lifetime," he said. "You must wait for your next lifetime."But Amba didn't wait. She built a funeral pyre and threw herself into the flames.She was reborn as Shikhandini, the daughter, and later the son, of King Drupada.Inspired by: Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharataby Devdutt Pattanaik.Notes: This story is on p. 38.Shiva
