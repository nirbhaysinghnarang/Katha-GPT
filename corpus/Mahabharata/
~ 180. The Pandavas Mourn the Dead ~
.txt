Laura Gibbs · 180. The Pandavas Mourn the Dead
Mourning the dead, the survivors went to the banks of the sacred river. The Pandavas were there, along with Dhritarashtra and Vidura, and all the women: Gandhari and Kunti, and all the wives, the widows, all the mothers and sisters and daughters.The rishi Narada joined in the mourning."Do you rejoice in your victory?" he asked Yudhishthira."I see only death," Yudhishthira replied. "I see only defeat. Worst of all, I have learned that Karna was Kunti's son. Karna knew, and said nothing. My elder brother is dead now, and I rule a kingdom that should have been his."
