Laura Gibbs · 127. Krishna Speaks with Karna
Before leaving Hastinapura, Krishna sought out Karna. "Because I love you," Krishna said, "I tell you the truth: you are Kunti's first-born son, Yudhishthira's elder brother. Yudhishthira doesn't know this, but if you tell him, he will gladly make you king. Go to him, Karna. It is the right thing to do.""It cannot be right for me to betray Duryodhana," Karna replied. "Duryodhana is my friend, and the Pandavas are my enemies. The truth of my birth changes nothing.""And your loyalty is Duryodhana's doom," Krishna said sadly.Thus Krishna's mission failed: he could not stop the coming war.
