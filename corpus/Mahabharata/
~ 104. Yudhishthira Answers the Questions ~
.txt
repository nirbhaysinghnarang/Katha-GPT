Laura Gibbs · 104. Yudhishthira Answers the Questions
Yudhishthira wept when he saw his dead brothers. Then he bent down to drink, and the crane said, "Stop! Answer my questions first."Unlike his brothers, Yudhishthira obeyed. "Ask your questions!" he said, and the crane transformed into a mighty yaksha."What is faster than wind?" the yaksha asked."The mind," replied Yudhishthira."What is more numerous than the grasses?""Our thoughts.""Who journeys always alone?" "The sun.""What enemy is invincible?" "Anger."The questions went on and on; Yudhishthira answered them all."You have answered well," said the yaksha. "You may revive one of your brothers. Choose which one."
