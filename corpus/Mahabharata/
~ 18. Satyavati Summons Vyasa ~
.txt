Laura Gibbs · 18. Satyavati Summons Vyasa
To continue the family line, Satyavati summoned Vyasa, who was living as a forest rishi."Mother, I will do what you want," he said, "but give me time to make myself presentable.""No," she said, "come now! The widows await you."Vyasa went to Ambika. Terrified by his appearance, she closed her eyes. Ambalika was also terrified, and the blood drained from her face.Vyasa told Satyavati, "Ambika's son will be blind, and Ambalika's son will be pale.""Go to Ambalika again," Satyavati said.But Ambalika had her maid take her place. She greeted Vyasa happily and showed no fear.
