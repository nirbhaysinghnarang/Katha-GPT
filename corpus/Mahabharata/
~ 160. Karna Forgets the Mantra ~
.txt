Laura Gibbs · 160. Karna Forgets the Mantra
As Karna worked to free his chariot wheel, he shouted, "Arjuna! Krishna! You are honor-bound to let me fix my chariot.""What kind of honor was it to humiliate Draupadi?" replied Krishna. "What honor was there in butchering Abhimanyu?"Karna said nothing, still struggling to free the wheel. Hearing Arjuna's chariot draw nearer, he decided to launch the Brahmastra. But suddenly he could not remember the mantra.It was all just as Parashurama had foretold."Kill him!" Krishna shouted.Arjuna hesitated, seeing Karna standing defenseless in the mud, but he obeyed Krishna's command.Arjuna's arrow struck Karna and killed him.
