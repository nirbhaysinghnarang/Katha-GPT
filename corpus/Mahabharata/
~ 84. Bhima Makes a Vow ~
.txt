Laura Gibbs · 84. Bhima Makes a Vow
Despite the miracle, Duryodhana continued to taunt Draupadi, baring his thigh. "Come, slave! Sit on your master's thigh."Bhima shouted, "I'll smash your thigh someday, Duryodhana! As for you, Dushasana: I'll rip you open and drink your blood!""My hair will stay unbound," Draupadi vowed, "until I wash it in Dushasana's blood.""Death to you all!" Bhima added. "Death to Duryodhana and his ninety-nine brothers!"As Bhima spoke, the dice-board burst into flames.Vidura could stay silent no longer. "Draupadi has God's protection. You all saw it. Brother, you must do something," he said to Dhritarashtra, "before it's too late!"
