Laura Gibbs · 112. Prince Uttara and Arjuna Ride into Battle
Brihannala then drove straight to the cremation grounds. "Fool!" Uttara shouted. "What are you doing?""Preparing for victory," he replied, opening the bundle of weapons. "Behold, the Gandiva bow! And I am Prince Arjuna.""Forgive me," said Uttara, astonished. "I will drive the chariot."Arjuna then blew his conch, and Drona recognized the sound."It's Arjuna," he exclaimed. Then he turned to Duryodhana. "Sire, you should return to Hastinapura. Now is not the time for you to fight the Pandavas.""Now is exactly the time!" replied Duryodhana.And so the Kauravas prepared to face Arjuna and Virata's army in battle.
