Laura Gibbs · 142. Bhishma Lies on the Bed of Arrows
Bhishma lay on the bed of arrows but did not die; he had the power to choose the moment of his death, and he chose to wait."I'm thirsty," he said, and Arjuna shot an arrow into the ground. Water burst forth; thus Bhishma's mother, Ganga, quenched his thirst.Bhishma urged Duryodhana to seek peace with the Pandavas. Karna was there too, and sought Bhishma's forgiveness. Again, Bhishma urged peace. "Listen, Karna: you are Kunti's son," he said. "End this war with your brothers."But instead, Karna donned his armor, ready to fight now that Bhishma had left the battlefield.
