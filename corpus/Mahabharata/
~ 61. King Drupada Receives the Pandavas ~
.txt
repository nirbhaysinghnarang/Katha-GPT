"We must go explain this to my father," said Draupadi, and she then led the five Pandavas back to the palace.King Drupada had already guessed who these five brahmins must be. "If you are who I think you are," he said to Yudhishthira, smiling, "I know you cannot lie to me. Tell me truthfully: who are you?""I am Yudhishthira, son of Pandu, once a prince of Hastinapura, and these are my brothers: Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva. The lovely Draupadi will be our wife."King Drupada stared at Yudhishthira in confusion."We will all marry Draupadi," Yudhishthira repeated.
