Laura Gibbs · 147. Abhimanyu Enters the Maze
As Arjuna battled the suicide squadron, Drona arranged his army in a maze formation. Only Arjuna knew the counterattack.Only Arjuna... and his son. "I learned this secret in the womb," said Abhimanyu. "I can break the maze; I just don't know how to get out.""Don't worry!" Bhima assured him. "We'll be with you."Abhimanyu broke through, but the Kaurava forces led by Jayadratha sealed the breach immediately, cutting Abhimanyu off from the Pandavas. He fought fiercely, even using his chariot wheel as a weapon, but the Kauravas overwhelmed him, and Abhimanyu died there, trapped inside the maze, alone.
