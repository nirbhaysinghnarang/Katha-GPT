Laura Gibbs · 159. The Duel Continues
As Karna battled with Arjuna, Shalya, Karna's charioteer, said, "I see you're feeling anxious, understandably. Arjuna is a great warrior.""You are my charioteer!" Karna shouted angrily. "Not Arjuna's!" But Shalya failed to offer Karna any encouragement.The duel went on and on as Arjuna and Karna fired arrows at one another, wheeling their chariots around to face each other again and again. Then Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud. "Get out and free the wheel!" Karna told Shalya.But Shalya refused. "That's no task for a king like me."So Karna leaped down to free the wheel himself.
