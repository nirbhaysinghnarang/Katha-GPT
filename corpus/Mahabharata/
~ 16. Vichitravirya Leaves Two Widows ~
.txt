Laura Gibbs · 16. Vichitravirya Leaves Two Widows
When Vichitravirya died, he left behind two widows, the princesses of Kashi: Ambika and Ambalika. Both were childless."Who will be king of Hastinapura now?" Satyavati wailed. In desperation, she turned to Bhishma for help. "It is lawful for a dead man's brother to continue the family line," she told him. "You are his half-brother! You must marry the princesses.""You of all people know I cannot do that," Bhishma replied. "Your father compelled me to renounce all offspring."Satyavati then said something that took Bhishma completely by surprise. "Then I must summon my son. He is our only hope."
