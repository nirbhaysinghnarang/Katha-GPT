Laura Gibbs · 111. Duryodhana Attacks Virata
Duryodhana was allied with Susharman, king of Trigarta and an enemy of King Virata. "We should attack Virata now," said Susharman, "and steal his cattle! Without Kichaka to lead his army, Virata will be defenseless."This plan delighted Duryodhana, and he launched an attack immediately. Virata commanded his young son, Prince Uttara, to defend the kingdom, but Uttara did not even have a charioteer."I will be your charioteer," said Brihannala, and Uttara burst out laughing. "You are the dancing teacher!" he scoffed. "I need a warrior to escort me.""Trust me," said Brihannala. "I will carry you to victory."
