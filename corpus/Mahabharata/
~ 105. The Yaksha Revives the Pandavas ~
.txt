Laura Gibbs · 105. The Yaksha Revives the Pandavas
Yudhishthira answered the yaksha instantly. "Let Nakula live!""You surprise me," said the yaksha. "He is Madri's son.""And I am Kunti's son," said Yudhishthira. "The sons of both mothers must survive this exile.""You are indeed righteous!" said the yaksha. "I will revive all four."The four Pandavas arose, amazed to see a mighty yaksha standing there.Then the yaksha transformed. Before them stood Yama, the god of dharma, Yudhishthira's father. "I used the deer to lure you, my son," Yama explained. "I was testing you, and you have done well. I give all five of you my blessing."
