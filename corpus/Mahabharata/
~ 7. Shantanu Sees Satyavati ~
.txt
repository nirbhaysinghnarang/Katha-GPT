King Shantanu went hunting one day.Again, he saw a beautiful woman by the river.Again, he fell in love at first sight."Marry me!" he said."You must ask my father's permission," she replied. "Who are you?" Shantanu asked. "And who is your father?""I am Satyavati," she said. "My father is a fisherman.""Let me marry your daughter!" Shantanu said to the fisherman."I agree," he said, "under one condition: when Satyavati bears you a son, that son must inherit the kingdom."But Shantanu could not agree to this condition because he had named Devavrata as his heir.
