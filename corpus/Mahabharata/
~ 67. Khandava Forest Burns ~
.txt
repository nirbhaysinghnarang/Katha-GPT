Laura Gibbs · 67. Khandava Forest Burns
A brahmin approached Arjuna and Krishna in Khandava Forest. "Feed me!" he said. Then he revealed himself as Agni, the fire-god. "Drive Indra's rain away so I can eat the fat of the animals."In exchange, Agni offered weapons: the Gandiva bow for Arjuna, and the Sudarshana-Chakra discus for Krishna.As the fire raged, Arjuna and Krishna kept Indra's rain away, shooting their arrows into the sky. Agni thus consumed the forest's trees and animals. Only a few birds escaped, plus the naga Ashwasena, and also Mayasura, architect of the asuras, who built a splendid palace for the Pandavas.

Notes: This story is from Chapter 6: City of Splendour. Narayan has Shakuni narrate this story to Duryodhana at Yudhishthira's rajasuya, but the events take place earlier, in the Khandava-daha Parva. More about Ashwasena here: The story of Ashwasena and Arjuna’s Diadem.burning of Khandava forest
