Laura Gibbs · 125. Krishna Comes to Hastinapura
Bhishma, Drona, and all the elders of Hastinapura escorted Krishna to the palace.There Krishna visited Kunti, who hadn't seen her sons for thirteen years. "Tell them they must act now," she said. "The time has come for them to destroy their enemies."Duryodhana invited Krishna to a banquet, but Krishna refused."You hate the Pandavas," he said, "so you hate me. I won't eat the food of hatred with you. I will go to Vidura's house instead."At dinner, Vidura warned Krishna of Duryodhana's plans, but Krishna only smiled. "I fear nothing," he said, "nor should you, my friend."
