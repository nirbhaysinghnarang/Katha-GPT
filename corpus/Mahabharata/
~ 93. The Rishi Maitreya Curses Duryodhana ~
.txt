Laura Gibbs · 93. The Rishi Maitreya Curses Duryodhana
After visiting the Pandavas in their forest exile, the rishi Maitreya went to Hastinapura. "You must make peace between your sons and your nephews," he said to King Dhritarashtra. "If not, it will lead to the annihilation of your family line."But Duryodhana just laughed at Maitreya and slapped his thigh as he had done when taunting Draupadi. "I curse you, Duryodhana!" said Maitreya. "One day Bhima will crush that thigh.""Take back your curse!" begged Duryodhana, truly alarmed."The only solution is to make peace with the Pandavas," Maitreya replied.But Duryodhana would never make peace with his cousins.
