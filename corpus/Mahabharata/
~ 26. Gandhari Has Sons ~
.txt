Laura Gibbs · 26. Gandhari Has Sons
Pandu now had five sons by his two wives, but Dhritarashtra's wife Gandhari still had no children, although she had been pregnant for years. In frustration, she struck her belly, and a ball of flesh emerged.Gandhari despaired, but Vyasa assured her, "You will have many children." He divided the flesh into a hundred pieces, putting them into pots. "These will be one hundred sons," Vyasa said."I'd like a daughter too," said Gandhari.Vyasa brought another pot, and put a piece of flesh into that pot also.The children grew in the pots: one hundred sons and one daughter.
