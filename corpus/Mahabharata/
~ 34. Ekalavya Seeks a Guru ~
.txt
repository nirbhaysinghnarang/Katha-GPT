Laura Gibbs · 34. Ekalavya Seeks a Guru
Ekalavya, a boy who lived in the forest, asked Drona to be his guru, but Drona refused. Ekalavya then made a statue of Drona and trained himself under the gaze of this statue. He became a remarkable archer.One day Arjuna's hunting dog was barking. To silence the dog, Ekalavya shot arrows into the dog's mouth in a way that did not harm the dog but kept it from closing its mouth.When he saw this, Arjuna was dismayed. "Look at this, Drona!" he cried. "You promised I would be the greatest archer, but even I cannot shoot like this."Inspired by: Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharataby Devdutt Pattanaik.Notes: This story is on p. 63. Ekalavya is a member of a tribe called Nishadas in the epic. Ekalavya
