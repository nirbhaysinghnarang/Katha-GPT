Laura Gibbs · 52. The House in Varanavata Burns
The royal administrator in Varanavata, Purochana, was Duryodhana's agent. The Pandavas knew he planned to kill them in a fire. "We'll beat him to it," said Yudhishthira, and he ordered Bhima to set the palace on fire.The Pandavas escaped through their tunnel, while Purochana died in the flames. A mother and her five sons also died in the fire. They had come to the palace seeking food and drink, and there they fell asleep, intoxicated.The next day, when their charred remains were discovered, Duryodhana was delighted, thinking the Pandavas and their mother Kunti had died in the fire.
