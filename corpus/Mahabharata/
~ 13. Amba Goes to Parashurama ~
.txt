Laura Gibbs · 13. Amba Goes to Parashurama
Amba then sought an avenger who would fight Bhishma, but the kshatriya-warriors were all afraid of him, and no one would help her.Then Amba went to Parashurama, the brahmin-warrior who had been Bhishma's teacher."What Bhishma did to you was wrong," Parashurama said to Amba. "I agree to fight him for you."Parashurama challenged Bhishma, and Bhishma reluctantly agreed to fight his guru. They fought for many days and, to Parashurama's surprise, he could not defeat his former pupil. "No one can kill Bhishma unless he wishes to die," Parashurama told Amba. "There is no way to defeat him."Inspired by: Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharataby Devdutt Pattanaik.Notes: This story is on p. 37.Parashurama and Bhishma
