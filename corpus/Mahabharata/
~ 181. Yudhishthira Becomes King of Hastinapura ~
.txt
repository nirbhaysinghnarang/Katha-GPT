After the war, Yudhishthira decided to renounce the world. "I will live in the forest, eating only roots and fruits. I will make no judgments. I will issue no commands."But his brothers and Draupadi protested, insisting that he must become king."Stop indulging yourself and your feelings," Krishna told him. "You will become king; it is your dharma."So Yudhishthira was crowned king, as Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva stood beside him, along with their wife Draupadi and their mother Kunti.He appointed Yuyutsu, Dhritarashtra's only surviving son, to care for the old king and attend to his needs.
