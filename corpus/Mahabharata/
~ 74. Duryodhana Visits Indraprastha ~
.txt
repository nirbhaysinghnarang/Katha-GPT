After Arjuna returned, the Pandavas organized a grand coronation ceremony for Yudhishthira and invited the royal families from neighboring kingdoms as their guests. Their cousin Duryodhana was one of those guests.Seeing the splendid palace of Indraprastha, built by the magic of the divine Mayasura, Duryodhana raged with jealousy.Mistaking a shimmering marble floor for a pool, he tucked up his garment to stay dry. The Pandavas laughed.Next, Duryodhana got drenched falling into a pool that he thought was a floor, and the Pandavas laughed even louder. "He sees no better than his father," Draupadi joked.Duryodhana vowed revenge.
