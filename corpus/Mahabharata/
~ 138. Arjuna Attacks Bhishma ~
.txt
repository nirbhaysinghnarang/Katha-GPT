Laura Gibbs · 138. Arjuna Attacks Bhishma
"I see you hesitating to kill Bhishma," Krishna said to Arjuna, "but you must not hesitate. Kill him!" Krishna then raced the chariot towards Bhishma, and Arjuna rained arrows down upon him, while Bhishma only smiled. "Well done!" he shouted, praising his great-nephew."I'll kill him myself then," said Krishna, leaping from the chariot and raising his discus."O God," Bhishma prayed, "death at your hands is salvation.""No!" Arjuna pulled Krishna's arm back. "You vowed not to fight; it is for me to do."But Arjuna did not kill Bhishma that day, and the battle raged on and on.
