Laura Gibbs · 88. The Exile Begins
Many faithful followers accompanied the Pandavas and Draupadi into the wilderness."Please go home," Yudhishthira told them. "The forest is dangerous, and I cannot keep you safe. Return to Hastinapura, and we too shall return when our years of exile are complete." Yudhishthira was worried how they would feed themselves in the wilderness; they could not feed all these followers too. The family priest then urged Yudhishthira to pray to Surya, the sun-god, source of the world's bounty. Surya appeared and gave Yudhishthira a copper bowl."Let Draupadi cook with this bowl," Surya said, "and it will always be full."
