Laura Gibbs · 123. Krishna Consoles the Pandavas
As Yudhishthira contemplated the coming war, he despaired. "Is there no way to obtain peace?" he asked Krishna."I myself will go to Hastinapura," Krishna offered. "I have no hope of changing Duryodhana's mind, but this way you will know we tried every option."Sahadeva, alone among his brothers, rejected peace. "For what Duryodhana tried to do to Draupadi," he said, "we must kill him, and Shakuni too."Draupadi agreed. "I too hope Krishna's mission will fail," she admitted."The wrongs you have suffered will be avenged," Krishna promised her. "The war is coming, and no one can stop it."
