Laura Gibbs · 85. King Dhritarashtra Grants Draupadi a Boon
"Enough!" shouted King Dhritarashtra, intervening at last. Then he turned his blind eyes towards Draupadi. "You have been steadfast throughout this ordeal. Make a request, and I will grant it."Draupadi replied immediately. "Free Yudhishthira from slavery!""Done!" agreed Dhritarashtra. "Make another request.""Free Yudhisthira's brothers," Draupadi said."Done! You may make a third request.""That is all," Draupadi said. "I ask for nothing more.""Then I restore everything!" proclaimed Dhritarashtra. "Wealth, kingdoms, power, everything you lost is yours again. Return to your home in peace."So Draupadi and her husbands mounted their chariots and began the journey to Indraprastha.
