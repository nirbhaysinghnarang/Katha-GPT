Laura Gibbs · 110. Duryodhana Searches for the Pandavas
The thirteenth year was almost over. Duryodhana sent his spies everywhere, but he could not find the Pandavas.Then he heard about the mysterious gandharvas who had killed his friend Kichaka in the court of King Virata. "That must be the Pandavas! I'm sure of it!"Drona and Bhishma both urged restraint. "If you find the Pandavas, make peace with them," they advised. Even Dushasana tried to persuade his brother to set aside his obsession with the Pandavas.But Duryodhana did not listen. He was determined to find the Pandavas and thus condemn them to another thirteen years of exile.
