Laura Gibbs · 33. A Crocodile Attacks Drona
One day when Drona was bathing in the river, a crocodile seized him.Drona yelled for help, and Arjuna came running. When he saw his guru in the crocodile's jaws, Arjuna shot five arrows that sliced through the crocodile and killed it. Drona was free!In gratitude, Drona taught Arjuna the mantra for a secret weapon. "Use this weapon with care," Drona warned him. "If you launch it against an enemy who is inferior to you, it will destroy the universe. Use it only on an overwhelming enemy, and you will triumph, no matter how powerful your opponent might be."
