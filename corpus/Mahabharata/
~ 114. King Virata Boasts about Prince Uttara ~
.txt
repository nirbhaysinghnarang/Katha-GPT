Laura Gibbs · 114. King Virata Boasts about Prince Uttara
"What say you, Kanka?" King Virata asked his dicing partner. "Isn't my son Uttara a remarkable warrior?""Indeed, my lord!" replied Yudhishthira. "Although his eunuch charioteer is even more remarkable."Enraged, Virata threw the dice at Yudhishthira, striking him in the forehead and drawing blood. Draupadi rushed to catch every drop, knowing that death awaited anyone who spilled Yudhishthira's blood to the ground.Uttara was shocked, aware as he was now of Yudhishthira's identity. "Take care with that old brahmin," he warned his father. "He might curse you."The king apologized, and Yudhishthira said soothingly, "It is already forgotten, sire."
