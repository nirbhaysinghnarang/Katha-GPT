Laura Gibbs · 65. King Dhritarashtra Deliberates
King Dhritarashtra was concerned about this new alliance of the Pandavas with King Drupada."Drupada has never forgiven Drona for making him divide his kingdom," Dhritarashtra said, "and now my nephews have become his sons-in-law.""This is indeed a dangerous alliance," Drona observed. "Drupada's own son Dhrishtadyumna is a formidable warrior."But Bhishma urged Dhritarashtra to make peace with his nephews. "You never should have sent them away to Varanavata. Let Vidura go congratulate them on their marriage and invite them back home to Hastinapura.""Yes," King Dhritarashtra decided at last. "It is time for the Pandavas to come home."
