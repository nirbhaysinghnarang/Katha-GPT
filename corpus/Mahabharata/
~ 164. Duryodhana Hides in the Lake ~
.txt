Laura Gibbs · 164. Duryodhana Hides in the Lake
Of Gandhari's hundred sons, only Duryodhana was left. He used a mantra to disappear under the waters of a lake, but Yudhishthira detected him."You can't hide, Duryodhana!" he shouted."I'm not hiding," Duryodhana replied. "I'm cooling my inner fire. The world is yours now: take it all, everything! You have won!""Very generous!" replied Yudhishthira. "But earlier, you would not give us our half of the kingdom, nor five villages, nor even a needlepoint of land."Duryodhana emerged from the water, wielding his mace. "I'm still here, and I will fight you all," he shouted angrily, "one by one."
