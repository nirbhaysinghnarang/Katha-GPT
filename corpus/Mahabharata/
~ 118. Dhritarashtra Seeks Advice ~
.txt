Laura Gibbs · 118. Dhritarashtra Seeks Advice
When Sanjaya returned from meeting with Yudhishthira, King Dhritarashtra was uncertain what to do and asked his brother Vidura for advice."You must disown Duryodhana," Vidura told him, "as ill omens at his birth foretold. Although he is your son, he is no better than a viper. Yudhishthira is a worthy heir, righteous and true to his word. Let Yudhishthira rule the kingdom. That is the only way you will know peace.""I realize you are right," Dhritarashtra admitted, "but I am strapped to Time's wheel; it turns me, and I cannot escape."And so King Dhritarashtra rejected Vidura's advice.
