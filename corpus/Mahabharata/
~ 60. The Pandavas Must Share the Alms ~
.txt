Laura Gibbs · 60. The Pandavas Must Share the Alms
Each day, the Pandavas would bring home the alms they had begged and give them to their mother, Kunti. So, after Arjuna won the wedding contest for Draupadi, Bhima decided to play a little joke. "Mother, come see what alms we have brought home today!" he shouted to her inside the house."Of course you must share the alms equally!" Kunti shouted back.Then she came outside and saw Draupadi, who gave Kunti a shy and confused smile."I cannot take back my words, dear," she said to her new daughter-in-law. "All five of my sons will be your husbands."
