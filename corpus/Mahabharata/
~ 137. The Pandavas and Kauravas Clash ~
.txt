Laura Gibbs · 137. The Pandavas and Kauravas Clash
On the first day, Bhima and Arjuna attacked the Kaurava armies relentlessly."Those two will destroy us," Duryodhana shouted, "and we don't even have Karna to help us."Bhishma glared at Duryodhana. "Do you want me to die?""No, no," Duryodhana stammered, "I just meant someone must stop Arjuna and Bhima!"Bhishma then shot an arrow that struck Krishna, drawing blood, but this only served to make Arjuna fight even more fiercely.Elsewhere on the battlefield, Dhrishtadyumna chased down Drona, his father's mortal enemy, but Drona killed his charioteer and nearly killed Dhrishtadyumna too; Bhima barely rescued him in time.
