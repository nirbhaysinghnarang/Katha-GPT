Laura Gibbs · 78. Duryodhana Invites the Pandavas to Hastinapura
Duryodhana sent Vidura to Indraprastha as his messenger, and Yudhishthira received his uncle happily; Vidura had always been a friend to them."What news from Hastinapura?" Yudhishthira asked."King Dhritarashtra has built a new palace to rival your palace here," said Vidura. "And your cousin Duryodhana invites you there for a game of dice."Before Yudhishthira could reply, Bhima shouted, "It's a trick."Draupadi added, "I do not think we should go, husband.""But Duryodhana knows I cannot refuse," Yudhishthira said, hesitantly. "You may tell our cousin that we accept his invitation."Vidura then returned to Hastinapura, full of foreboding.
