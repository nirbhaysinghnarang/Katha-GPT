Laura Gibbs · 40. The Story of Drona and Drupada
When Drona had trained the Pandavas and Kauravas, he demanded the guru-fee: he wanted revenge on King Drupada.This is why:Young Drupada had studied with Bharadwaja, Drona's father. As boys, Drupada and Drona were best friends. Time passed. Drupada became king, while Drona was only a poor brahmin, so poor he didn't even have milk to give to his little boy, Ashwatthama.Out of love for his son, Drona went to ask his friend Drupada for help."Friend?" King Drupada scoffed. "Friends must be equals, but you are not my equal in any way."Drona vowed revenge that day.
