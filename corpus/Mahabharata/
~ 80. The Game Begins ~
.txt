Laura Gibbs · 80. The Game Begins
Yudhishthira faced Shakuni, who played for his nephew, Duryodhana.Then the game began.First, they bet a few pearls. Shakuni won.Then a golden chariot. "I have won!" said Shakuni.Elephants and armies. "I have won!" said Shakuni.Enormous herds of cattle. "I have won!" said Shakuni.The wealth of entire kingdoms. "I have won!" said Shakuni.Vidura begged King Dhritarashtra to stop the match, but the king did nothing.Yudhishthira staked his brothers one by one. He lost.Yudhishthira staked himself. He lost.Yudhishthira staked his wife Draupadi. He lost.Yudhishthira had nothing left. Shakuni had won it all.
