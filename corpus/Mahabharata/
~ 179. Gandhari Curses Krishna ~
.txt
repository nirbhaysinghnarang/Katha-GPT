Laura Gibbs · 179. Gandhari Curses Krishna
Gandhari, however, was inconsolable. "Are you happy now, Krishna?" she said. "Your tricks killed all my sons.""Not so," Krishna replied. "Their karma killed them: the consequences of their actions and the wicked choices that they made. But in death they are transformed; you should rejoice that they are in heaven.""Your words mean nothing," shouted Gandhari, "and your actions also have consequences. Hear my curse: all the people of your tribe will destroy one another, and you will be left to die alone."Krishna said nothing, as he already knew of these events to come.All actions have consequences.
