Laura Gibbs · 143. Kunti Comes to Karna
The dawn before Karna joined the battle, Kunti came to see him."I know you are my mother," Karna said. "Krishna told me. But my love is for the mother and father who raised me, the charioteer and his wife. And for Duryodhana, who accepted me as I am, while you rejected me."Kunti wept, and Karna pitied her in that moment. "I promise I will fight Arjuna only," he said. "I will spare your other sons. That way, when this war is over, either Arjuna will be dead, or I will be, and you will still have five sons."
