Laura Gibbs · 139. Duryodhana Attacks with Elephants
Duryodhana attacked with elephants, but Bhima killed them all. "You elephants and you evil-minded Kauravas, meet your destroyer!" he shouted. "My mace will show you all the way to Yama's world!"On that day alone, Bhima killed eight of Duryodhana's brothers. "Dhritarashtra may have sired one hundred sons," Bhima snarled, "but I vow that I will kill them all."Duryodhana then landed a blow that knocked Bhima to the ground, whereupon Bhima's rakshasa son Ghatotkacha materialized out of nowhere, rescuing his father and joining the battle."We can't defeat the rakshasa!" Duryodhana shouted, retreating.Thus ended another day of battle.
