Laura Gibbs · 136. The War Begins
The armies of warriors on both sides were ready to begin the great war, but then Yudhishthira stepped forward and, setting aside his armor and weapons, he walked to the Kaurava side. "Is he surrendering already?" Duryodhana wondered. "Coward!"But Yudhishthira was not surrendering. Instead, he saluted Drona, his guru, then his great-uncle Bhishma, and all the Kaurava elders.His purpose accomplished, Yudhishthira returned to the Pandava side, took up his weapons and armor again, and gave the signal. "Begin!"So the war began, and it lasted eighteen days. Millions died, and their blood washed over Kurukshetra like a flood.
