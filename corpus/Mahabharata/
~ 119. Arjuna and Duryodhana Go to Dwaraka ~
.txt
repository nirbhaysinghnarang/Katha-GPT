Laura Gibbs · 119. Arjuna and Duryodhana Go to Dwaraka
As war loomed, Arjuna went to Dwaraka to ask Krishna for help, and Duryodhana did the same. Krishna was asleep when they arrived; Duryodhana sat at the head of Krishna's bed, and Arjuna sat reverently at Krishna's feet.When Krishna awoke, he saw Arjuna first, and then Duryodhana."I have my armies to offer," said Krishna, "and I offer myself, but not as a warrior. Let Arjuna choose first, as I saw him first.""I choose you," Arjuna said without hesitation.Duryodhana rejoiced because he also got what he wanted: armies of Yadava warriors who would fight on his side.
